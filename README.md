Bug Tracker

In my role as a Technology Consultant and Test Analyst in a large Software Implementation project, defect logging and tracking is vital. I have seen a couple different methods to do this, and was interested in attempting to make my own. I saw this as a great opportunity to learn about creating a frontend web application connected to a live database.

In this Bug Tracker, I utilize Java, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, SpringBoot, and REST Services to stand up a functioning defect tracker in which the user can create, edit, and track the defects of a given project.
